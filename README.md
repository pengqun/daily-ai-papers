# daily-ai-papers

All-in-one project to crawl, analyze, translate, display and chat with newest AI papers in a nice UI.

## Goal

Keeping up with the fast-moving AI research landscape is hard. New papers appear daily on arXiv and other venues, spanning topics from large language models to computer vision to reinforcement learning. **daily-ai-papers** aims to solve this by providing a single platform that automatically:

1. **Crawls** the latest AI papers from sources such as arXiv, Semantic Scholar, and conference proceedings.
2. **Analyzes** each paper to extract key metadata -- title, authors, abstract, main contributions, and relevant keywords.
3. **Translates** paper titles, abstracts, and summaries into multiple languages so non-English-speaking researchers can stay informed.
4. **Displays** everything in a clean, browsable web UI with search, filtering, and categorization.
5. **Chats** with paper content through an AI-powered conversational interface, letting users ask questions and get answers grounded in the paper text.

## Why This Project?

- **Information overload** -- Hundreds of AI papers are published every week. Manual tracking is unsustainable.
- **Language barriers** -- Many researchers work more efficiently in their native language.
- **Shallow reading** -- Abstracts alone don't always convey what matters. An interactive chat layer helps users dig deeper without reading the full paper upfront.
